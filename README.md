# Kaibash: a POSIX Shell

Kaibash is a POSIX shell, currently under active development. It conforms to IEEE 1003.1 XCU Standard fully, and only a few supersets have been defined (for the moment).

The source code will change a lot during the development. Please vew the blotter below for updates.

## Blotter

* Currently writing the grammar, I came up with a pseudo-AST scheme to represent the shell. A POSIX Bourne-based shell does not need an AST per se, so I am trying my best to make something fast and good
